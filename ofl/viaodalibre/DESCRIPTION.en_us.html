Viaoda Libre is a display font. Inspired by Vietnamese cultural symbolism,
Viaoda Libre is a mix of both the old and the new, appearing with traditional
elegance and modern professionalism at the same time. It is designed to
match media publications regarding tradition while also serve as titles and
subtitles. The typeface is to be further developed in the future, with hopes to
attain greater values for Vietnamese typeface.
